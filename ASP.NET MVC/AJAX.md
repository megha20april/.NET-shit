# What Happens Normally (Without AJAX)?

When you submit a form or click a link that sends a request to the server, the browser reloads the entire page to show the response. This is called a synchronous request ‚Äî it waits for the server to respond and replaces the whole page content.


# üöÄ What AJAX Does Differently

AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, and its goal is:

‚úÖ Send a request to the server
‚úÖ Receive a response
‚úÖ Update part of the page, not reload the whole page

# üîß But How Does AJAX Do That?

AJAX uses JavaScript‚Äôs XMLHttpRequest or the newer fetch() or Jquery's $.ajax() API to:
Send an HTTP request behind the scenes (in the background).
Receive the server's response (usually JSON or HTML).
Use JavaScript to update the DOM ‚Äî which means it changes content on the page using things like:

```js
document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = responseData;
```

> ‚û°Ô∏è The key part: The browser doesn't reload the page because JavaScript intercepts the request and directly manipulates the existing content.



# AJAX Helpers
- JQuery Unobtrusive AJAX library provides the AJAX helpers in Razor views

## üß† Why Do I Need AJAX Helpers?

You need AJAX helpers in ASP.NET Core MVC when you:
‚úÖ Want to do partial updates to the page without reloading
‚úÖ Want to use Razor syntax to simplify generating HTML and wiring up JS
‚úÖ Want to avoid manually writing JS code for every form or link

## What would i need to do if i don't use them?

In Razor:

```html
<form id="myForm">
    <input type="text" name="name" />
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
<div id="resultDiv"></div>

<script>
document.getElementById("myForm").addEventListener("submit", function (e) {
    e.preventDefault(); // stop normal post
    fetch('/Home/GetGreeting', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: new FormData(this)
    })
    .then(res => res.text())
    .then(html => {
        document.getElementById('resultDiv').innerHTML = html;
    });
});
</script>
```

In controller:

```csharp
[HttpPost]
public IActionResult GetGreeting(string name)
{
    return PartialView("_GreetingPartial", name);
}
```

Partial View (_GreetingPartial.cshtml):

```html
<p>Hello, @Model!</p>
```

‚úÖ Works perfectly, but requires manual JS every time.

## Now with AJAX helpers, I can just do

```csharp
@using (Ajax.BeginForm("GetGreeting", "Home",
    new AjaxOptions {
        HttpMethod = "POST",
        UpdateTargetId = "resultDiv",
        InsertionMode = InsertionMode.Replace
    }))
{
    <input type="text" name="name" />
    <input type="submit" value="Say Hello" />
}
```
It renders to plain HTML with extra data- attributes:

```html
<form action="/Home/GetGreeting"
      data-ajax="true"
      data-ajax-method="POST"
      data-ajax-update="#resultDiv"
      data-ajax-mode="replace"
      method="post">
    <input type="text" name="name" />
    <input type="submit" value="Say Hello">
</form>
```
This is now a special form: it will be caught by jQuery.Unobtrusive.Ajax.js.
who reads them and sends a AJAX request using $.ajax()
and injects response HTML into a DOM element

---

- Although these AJAX helpers look simpler but they are not that flexible.
- Hence, Explicit JS (jQuery) is more common and preferred today because throught them you control every part of the request.
- Microsoft considers these helpers legacy and has removed them from ASP.NET CORE as a default functionality.
