# What Happens Normally (Without AJAX)?

When you submit a form or click a link that sends a request to the server, the browser reloads the entire page to show the response. This is called a synchronous request ‚Äî it waits for the server to respond and replaces the whole page content.


# üöÄ What AJAX Does Differently

AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, and its goal is:

‚úÖ Send a request to the server
‚úÖ Receive a response
‚úÖ Update part of the page, not reload the whole page

# üîß But How Does AJAX Do That?

AJAX uses JavaScript‚Äôs XMLHttpRequest or the newer fetch() API to:
Send an HTTP request behind the scenes (in the background).
Receive the server's response (usually JSON or HTML).
Use JavaScript to update the DOM ‚Äî which means it changes content on the page using things like:

```js
document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = responseData;
```

> ‚û°Ô∏è The key part: The browser doesn't reload the page because JavaScript intercepts the request and directly manipulates the existing content.
