## ‚ùì What are Cross-Cutting Concerns?

**Cross-cutting concerns** are functionalities that **affect multiple parts of your application** but are not central to your business logic.

These are concerns you want to **"cut across" the whole app** (or many parts of it), but you don't want to repeat the code everywhere. So we try to handle them in a central, reusable, and clean way.

### ‚úÖ **Examples of Cross-Cutting Concerns:**

| Concern                            | What it does                                          |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Authentication & Authorization** | Who the user is and what they can do.                 |
| **Logging**                        | Tracking application behavior, errors, and usage.     |
| **Error Handling**                 | Handling exceptions consistently.                     |
| **Caching**                        | Temporarily storing data to improve performance.      |
| **Validation**                     | Ensuring data meets specific rules before processing. |
| **Security (e.g., encryption)**    | Protecting data across layers.                        |
| **Configuration Management**       | Centralized control of settings.                      |
| **Monitoring & Telemetry**         | Tracking app health, usage, and performance.          |

These concerns are **used across multiple layers/modules** (like controllers, services, data access) but are **not tied to the core purpose** of a feature.

### ‚ùå **What are *not* cross-cutting concerns?**

These are **core business logic**, specific to a domain or module:

* "Calculate user‚Äôs shopping cart total" ‚Äì **business logic**
* "Send a notification when an order is placed" ‚Äì **feature logic**
* "Apply tax rules on billing" ‚Äì **domain-specific rule**
* "Display blog posts" ‚Äì **application feature**

These are **not cross-cutting** because they **don‚Äôt apply to multiple areas** of the app. They're **feature-specific**.

### üí° How are Cross-Cutting Concerns Handled?

You **don‚Äôt want to write repetitive code**, so we use techniques like:

* **Middleware** (ASP.NET Core) ‚Üí For logging, auth, error handling, etc.
* **Filters** (MVC Filters: `ActionFilter`, `ExceptionFilter`, etc.)
* **Dependency Injection (DI)** ‚Üí For injecting services like loggers.
* **AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)** ‚Üí Concept of separating concerns (logging, caching, etc.) outside core logic.
* **Global Exception Handlers**, **Custom Attributes**, etc.
