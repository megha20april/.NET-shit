### 🔐 **Understanding Anonymous Identity & Security Context in ASP.NET Core**

When an HTTP request is made — whether it's from a logged-in user or not (for ex. when in development we locally host a razor page, and access the index page, without any authentication) — a **`HttpContext` object is *always* created** by ASP.NET Core for that request.

Inside that `HttpContext`, there's a `User` property which holds the **security context** — represented by a `ClaimsPrincipal` object.

Now, if the request **does not carry any login credentials** (like no auth cookie or token), the framework **still assigns a `ClaimsPrincipal`**, but this time with an **anonymous identity**.

This **anonymous identity** is just a way of saying:

* “There is a user making the request”
* But `IsAuthenticated = false`
* And `Name = null`
* And there are no claims/roles associated

The point is: the system always works with a user object — either an **authenticated one**, or an **anonymous one** — *so that the pipeline stays consistent*.

Now here's the key part:

> Just having an anonymous identity **does not restrict access**.

You can still access any controller or view **unless it has `[Authorize]`** or some other authorization logic.
If a page or API **does require authorization**, then:

* The system checks `HttpContext.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated`
* If it's `false`, the request is **denied or redirected**

So unless something explicitly checks for auth, **anonymous users are allowed** and the request continues like normal.
