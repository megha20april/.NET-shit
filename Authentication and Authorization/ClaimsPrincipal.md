# ClaimsPrincipal Object

- It is provided by .NET for its authentication system.
- It is a type of object that can contain all the info about the currently logged-in user.
- It is automatically managed by .NET and contains very useful methods (like LINQ) and properties (like IsAuthenticated etc.) which are populated and created internally by .NET
- Many things in .NET depend on it, several middlewares expect it (as they know how to interact with it internally) or Objects like HttpContext have it etc.
- It is a design pattern that simplifies and centralizes the way to manage user info in a structured manner.

- It contains:
    - Multiple Identities (ClaimsIdentity) 
    - And each identity has a list of claims (user.Claims)
    - These claims are basically the user's data related to that particular identity.
    - LINQ-friendly structures (so you can use .FirstOrDefault(), .Where(), etc.)
    - Properties like:
        - IsAuthenticated
        - Identity.Name
        - IsInRole("Admin")

 ```   
  HttpContext (this object's User property contains a ClaimsPrincipal object that contains the user data passed in that request)
  └── User (ClaimsPrincipal object)  --> contains IEnumerable<ClaimsIdentity>
        ├── Identity 1 (e.g., Student)   --> (ClaimsIdentity object)
        │     ├── Claim: Role = Student
        │     ├── Claim: Name = Megha
        │     └── Claim: Age = 21
        ├── Identity 2 (e.g., Driver License)
        │     ├── Claim: LicenseNumber = ABC123
        │     └── Claim: State = MP
```

# 🔐 ASP.NET Core Authentication Flow — From Login to Authenticated Requests

---

## 🌱 **Part 1: User Logs In (POST /login)**

### 🧾 Step 1: User sends a POST request

```http
POST /login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "megha",
  "password": "12345"
}
```

---

### 🧠 Step 2: You validate credentials in your controller

ASP.NET doesn't know whether the credentials are valid or what claims to assign hence we create the ClaimPrincipal object for that user manually after validation

```csharp
[HttpPost]
public async Task<IActionResult> Login(LoginModel model)
{
    var user = await _userManager.FindByNameAsync(model.Username);

    if (user != null && await _userManager.CheckPasswordAsync(user, model.Password))
    {
        // ✅ Step 3: You create the claims
        var claims = new List<Claim>
        {
            new Claim(ClaimTypes.Name, user.UserName),
            new Claim(ClaimTypes.Email, user.Email),
            new Claim(ClaimTypes.Role, "Admin"),
        };

        // ✅ Step 4: Wrap claims in a ClaimsIdentity
        var identity = new ClaimsIdentity(claims, CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);

        // ✅ Step 5: Create a ClaimsPrincipal
        var principal = new ClaimsPrincipal(identity);

        // ✅ Step 6: Tell ASP.NET to issue a login cookie
        await HttpContext.SignInAsync(principal);

        return Ok("Logged in!");
    }

    return Unauthorized();
}
```

---

## 📦 Under-the-hood of Step 6

ASP.NET **encrypts the `ClaimsPrincipal`** and stores it in an **authentication cookie** (sent in response):

```
Set-Cookie: .AspNetCore.Cookies=long-encrypted-auth-cookie
```

This cookie lives in the user's browser.

---

## 🔁 Part 2: Any Request After Login (e.g., GET /dashboard)

Now the browser sends the auth cookie **automatically**:

```
GET /dashboard
Cookie: .AspNetCore.Cookies=long-encrypted-auth-cookie
```

---

### 🔧 Step 7: Middleware kicks in automatically

This time, you **don’t** do anything manually.

ASP.NET Core does:

* ✅ Extract cookie
* ✅ Decrypt it
* ✅ Reconstruct the `ClaimsPrincipal`
* ✅ Sets it on `HttpContext.User`

---

### 🎯 Step 8: You can now access the user in any layer

**Anywhere in your app**, this now works out-of-the-box:

```csharp
User.Identity.IsAuthenticated   // true
User.Identity.Name              // "megha"
User.IsInRole("Admin")          // true
User.FindFirst(ClaimTypes.Email)?.Value
```

Also available in:

* Razor Views: `@User.Identity.Name`
* Middleware: `context.User`
* Filters, services, etc.

---

## 🔓 Part 3: Protecting Endpoints

You can now use the `[Authorize]` attribute:

```csharp
[Authorize]
public IActionResult Dashboard()
{
    return View();
}

[Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]
public IActionResult AdminPanel()
{
    return View();
}
```

---

## 🚪 Logging Out

To log out the user and clear the cookie:

```csharp
await HttpContext.SignOutAsync();
```

This removes the auth cookie, and `HttpContext.User` becomes an **empty unauthenticated user**.
