## üß® 1. Pre-1980s: Assembly & BASIC

- Computers were programmed in Assembly ‚Äî low-level, hard, and risky.
- Microsoft created BASIC (Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) interpreters to make programming easier.
- These were interpreted languages, not compiled or safe.

> üß† Memory was completely manual ‚Äî you could crash the system just by misusing a number.

## üíæ 2. 1980s‚ÄìEarly 90s: DOS, Windows, and WinAPI

- Microsoft made MS-DOS (a CLI based OS in which applications were written in C or Assembly) and later Windows 1.0‚Äì3.1.
- Developers used C and C++, writing to the WinAPI (Windown API for drawing GUI) ‚Äî painful and error-prone.
- Microsoft then released Visual C++ and MFC (Microsoft Foundation Classes was a C++ library for Windows GUI apps) to make GUI coding easier.

## üß± 3. Early 1990s: Visual Basic & RAD

- Microsoft launched Visual Basic ‚Äî a drag-and-drop GUI builder with simple code which was not object-oriented.
- Easy to use but not scalable or robust.
- Still used shared libraries (DLLs) that caused ‚ÄúDLL Hell.‚Äù

## üß© 4. Mid 90s: COM and ActiveX

- Microsoft created COM (Component Object Model) to share code across apps/languages.
- Hard to version, buggy, and deeply tied to Windows Registry.

> üß† Think of it as an early attempt at code reuse and plugins.

## üî• 5. Late 90s: Java Rises & Microsoft Reacts

- Java (by Sun) introduced portable, memory-safe, object-oriented apps.
- Microsoft made J++, a modified Java ‚Äî which led to legal trouble.
- They needed their own modern, language-flexible, memory safe platform with cross-platform compatibility (like it should run on multiple OS).

## üöÄ 6. 2000‚Äì2002: Birth of .NET

- Microsoft built .NET Framework:
- CLR (Common Language Runtime) ‚Äì Like Java‚Äôs JVM
- C# ‚Äì A new, modern language
- ASP.NET, WinForms, WPF ‚Äì For web and GUI apps
- Garbage collection and memory safety baked in
- Windows only.

> üß† It was Microsoft‚Äôs clean break from the past: safe, managed, and cross-language.

## üåê 7. 2016‚ÄìNow: .NET Core ‚Üí .NET 5+ (Modern .NET)

- .NET Framework was originally Windows-only.
- Microsoft open-sourced it and rebuilt it from scratch as .NET Core, then after some versions of it, it dropped the "Core" from its name and rebranded it as just .NET 5 and beyond.
- Fully cross-platform: Windows, Linux, macOS
- Can build:
    Web apps (ASP.NET Core, new ver of ASP.NET)
    Desktop & mobile (MAUI, WPF, WinForms)
    Games (Unity uses C#)
    Browser apps (Blazor)
    APIs and CLIs

- CLR can run C#, F# and VB.NET
- and it compiles all these languages to IL (Intermediate Language)
- which is the converted to native machine code at runtime using JIT compiler or it does it ahead of time using AOT compiler
