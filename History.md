## 🧨 1. Pre-1980s: Assembly & BASIC

- Computers were programmed in Assembly — low-level, hard, and risky.
- Microsoft created BASIC (Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) interpreters to make programming easier.
- These were interpreted languages, not compiled or safe.

> 🧠 Memory was completely manual — you could crash the system just by misusing a number.

## 💾 2. 1980s–Early 90s: DOS, Windows, and WinAPI

- Microsoft made MS-DOS (a CLI based OS in which applications were written in C or Assembly) and later Windows 1.0–3.1.
- Developers used C and C++, writing to the WinAPI (Windown API for drawing GUI) — painful and error-prone.
- Microsoft then released Visual C++ and MFC (Microsoft Foundation Classes was a C++ library for Windows GUI apps) to make GUI coding easier.

## 🧱 3. Early 1990s: Visual Basic & RAD

- Microsoft launched Visual Basic — a drag-and-drop GUI builder with simple code which was not object-oriented.
- Easy to use but not scalable or robust.
- Still used shared libraries (DLLs) that caused “DLL Hell.”

## 🧩 4. Mid 90s: COM and ActiveX

- Microsoft created COM (Component Object Model) to share code across apps/languages.


Hard to version, buggy, and deeply tied to Windows Registry.

> 🧠 Think of it as an early attempt at code reuse and plugins.

## 🔥 5. Late 90s: Java Rises & Microsoft Reacts

- Java (by Sun) introduced portable, memory-safe, object-oriented apps.
- Microsoft made J++, a modified Java — which led to legal trouble.
- They needed their own modern, language-flexible, memory safe platform with cross-platform compatibility (like it should run on multiple OS).

🚀 6. 2000–2002: Birth of .NET
Microsoft built .NET Framework:

CLR (Common Language Runtime) – Like Java’s JVM

C# – A new, modern language

ASP.NET, WinForms, WPF – For web and GUI apps

Garbage collection and memory safety baked in

🧠 It was Microsoft’s clean break from the past: safe, managed, and cross-language.

🌐 7. 2016–Now: .NET Core → .NET 5+ (Modern .NET)
.NET was originally Windows-only.

Microsoft open-sourced and rebuilt it as .NET Core, then unified everything into .NET 5, 6, 7, 8…

Fully cross-platform: Windows, Linux, macOS

Can build:

Web apps (ASP.NET Core)

Desktop & mobile (MAUI, WPF, WinForms)

Games (Unity uses C#)

Browser apps (Blazor)

APIs and CLIs
