* Lets you:

  * View and manage **SQL Server databases**
  * Run queries
  * Use EF Core Migrations
  * Connect to **LocalDB**, **SQL Server**, or **Azure SQL**
* similar to a lightweight **SSMS** inside Visual Studio.

## ✅ **How is SQL Server Object Explorer different from SQL Server and SSMS?**

### 🔸 SQL Server (DBMS):

* **Actual database engine** that stores and manages your data.
* Installed on your system or remotely.
* Can host **multiple databases**, support **multi-user**, **remote access**, advanced features.
* **Resource-heavy**, runs as a **Windows Service**.

### 🔸 SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS):

* A standalone **tool** to interact with SQL Server.
* Has full features: query tuning, monitoring, jobs, users, backups, etc.
* Used by DBAs and power users.

### 🔸 SQL Server Object Explorer:

* A **simplified, embedded DB tool inside Visual Studio**.
* Lighter than SSMS.
* Great for **dev workflow**, especially with **Entity Framework**.

## 🧠 Misconception Clarified

> ❌ “LocalDB can only host a single server or database” — not quite true.

✔️ **LocalDB can host multiple databases** under a single instance — just like SQL Server. You can create multiple databases, just not multiple users or network access.

## 📌 TL;DR Summary

* **SQL Server Object Explorer**: Visual Studio’s built-in database explorer, great for SQL dev.
* **Server Explorer**: Broader tool for managing many non-database things like logs, services.
* **SQL Server**: Full database engine. Heavy, powerful, production-ready.
* **SSMS**: Standalone pro-grade tool to interact with SQL Server.
* **LocalDB**: Lightweight SQL Server for **local dev**, single-user, no remote, auto-start.
