# DB Migrations in ASP.NET Core

Migrations are a code-based way to:
- Create the database schema from C# classes (models).
- Update the database schema when your models change â€” without deleting existing data.
- Basically, track all DDL changes in your data models.

## ðŸ”„ The Migration Flow (Simple Version)

- We have an initial model, that we created the first time.

```csharp
public class User {
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}
```
- We do migration

```bash
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
```

- EF tries to compares this new model with a previous model,but finds nothing, Thus, establishes that this is the initial migration
- Then it creates a C# file `InitialCreate.cs` in Migrations/

```csharp
migrationBuilder.CreateTable(
    name: "Users",
    columns: table => new {
        Id = table.Column<int>(nullable: false)
            .Annotation("SqlServer:Identity", "1, 1"),
        Name = table.Column<string>(nullable: true)
    });
```

- It then executes these pending changes against our database on `dotnet ef database update`
- NOW, EF takes a snapshot of our updated model and saves a file called `ModelSnapshot.cs`
- This snapshot is used next time to detect what changed.
- EF basically takes snapshot after each migration.

---

- Now if we update something:

```csharp
  public class User {
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Email { get; set; }  // ðŸ‘ˆ new property
}
```

```bash
dotnet ef migrations add AddEmailToUser
```

EF:
- Looks at current model
- Looks at `ModelSnapshot`
- Detects new `Email` Property
- Generates migration file for it:

```csharp
migrationBuilder.AddColumn<string>(
    name: "Email",
    table: "Users",
    nullable: true);
```

- Now agian we do: `dotnet ef database update`
- EF executes the migrations against our database by converting all these instructions to SQL
