## .NET SDK vs .NET runtime

- sdk contains all the libraries, compiler, command line tools, project templates and so on... required to develop .net applications. For developers.
- while on the other hand, .net runtime contains things like CLR, BCL, GC and JIT which are required to execute the applications only. For end users.

## Info about framework's installations

- windows comes with .net framework (old version)
- it doesn't come with any new version, like .net 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.
- but when we install visual studio, it automatically installs the lastest .net sdk

## .Net or .Net Framework

- it's a platform that contains the .net runtime, .net sdk, asp.net core runtime, desktop runtime etc.

## Contents of .NET SDK

development tools like:
- compiler called Roslyn
- debugger
- project templates
- package manager called nuget
- build tools like MSBuild
- .net cli
- dotnet driver for running commands
- .net runtime and libraries to run applications while development.
- etc.....

## Contents of .NET Runtime

things to execute/run the application:
- Common Language Runtime, CLR --> runs the code by managing memory, handling exceptions, ensuring type safety etc.
- Garbage Collector, GC
- Just-In-Time Compiler, JIT compiler --> converts IL code to machine code at runtime for execution.
- Base Class Libraries, BCL --> libraries used by code to run like System.* namespaces etc.

## ASP.NET Core Runtime

adds web specific functionality on top of .net runtime like:
- HTTP request/response handling
- MVC framework
- Web API capabilities
- Middleware pipeline
- Routing engine
